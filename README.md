# Text File Hashing

This program takes a text file and splits up its contents using punctuation and whitespace as delimiters. It then eliminates all stop words provided in the corresponding file and creates a hashtable with the remaining words. The result file is a list of every word found in the given text and the line numbers in which they appear.
